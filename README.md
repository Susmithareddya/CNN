# MNIST Digit Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow
Overview :
This code loads the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow Datasets, splits it into training, validation, and test sets, and then trains a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) on the training set. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set. The code also includes some visualization of the data and the training history.

Prerequisites :
The following libraries need to be installed:

TensorFlow 2.x,
TensorFlow Datasets,
Numpy,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Pandas.


Running the code:
Simply run the code in a Python environment that has the required libraries installed. Make sure to set the correct paths to load and save data and models.
